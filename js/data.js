Giants are huge and tall Mechas that tower over their enemies with big melee weapons, their durable body and high defensive stats makes up for their slow movement speed.

Shapeshifters are adaptive Mechas that has the ability to transform into anything, making it complicated for enemies to counter them. They are easily confused with Legions at first sight, but once they start transforming into a plane, a tank or a canon, it will be too late before the enemy realise that they are up against a Shapeshifter. Rumors has it that Shapeshifters can even transform into duplicated versions of some Mecha species, and with their high attack and defence capability, Shapeshifters are a deadly force that instills fear.`,

Relics' size comes head to head in rival with Giants, but they have large internal energy storage. They are flexible in combat, having the ability to excel in both close and far range, due to their own very unique weapon.`,
